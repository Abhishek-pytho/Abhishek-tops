# What are negative indexes and why are they used?


When we use the index to access elements
from the end of a list, it’s called reverse indexing.
In reverse indexing, the indexing of elements start from
the last element with the index number being ‘−1’.
The second last element has the index ‘−2’, and so on.
These indexes used in reverse indexing are called negative indexes.
